# Voice Reference

The `voices` package provides reference information for ElevenLabs pre-made voices.

## Installation

```go
import "github.com/grokify/go-elevenlabs/voices"
```

## Quick Start

### Use Voice Constants

```go
import "github.com/grokify/go-elevenlabs/voices"

// Use constants instead of hard-coded IDs
audio, err := client.TextToSpeech().Simple(ctx, voices.Rachel, "Hello world")

// Other popular voices
audio, err := client.TextToSpeech().Simple(ctx, voices.Adam, "Deep male voice")
audio, err := client.TextToSpeech().Simple(ctx, voices.George, "British accent")
```

### Look Up Voice Metadata

```go
// Get voice by ID
v := voices.GetVoice(voices.Rachel)
fmt.Printf("Name: %s\n", v.Name)           // "Rachel"
fmt.Printf("Gender: %s\n", v.Gender)       // "female"
fmt.Printf("Accent: %s\n", v.Accent)       // "American"
fmt.Printf("Use Case: %s\n", v.UseCase)    // "Narration, audiobooks"

// Get voice by name (case-insensitive)
v := voices.GetVoiceByName("rachel")
```

### Filter Voices

```go
// Find female voices
females := voices.FilterByGender("female")

// Find British voices
british := voices.FilterByAccent("British")

// Find young voices
young := voices.FilterByAge("young")
```
